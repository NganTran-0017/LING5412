# **LING 5412 FINAL PROJECT**

## SemEval 2022 Task 4: Patronizing and Condescending Language Detection (PCL)

PCL is often involuntary and unconscious and the authors using such language are usually trying to help the communities in need, by raising awareness, moving the audience to action or standing for the rights of the under-represented. But PCL can potentially be very harmful, as it feeds stereotypes, routinizes discrimination and drives to greater exclusion. In our project, we applied classic machine learning, and deep learning models to classify the documents with PCL.
